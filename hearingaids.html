              Before someone gets hearing aids, a hearing test can help
              determine if the person is a good match for Direct-to-Consumer
              hearing aids. It may show that they need prescription hearing aids
              and services from a hearing care expert. The hearing test also
              checks if they need medical care prior to buying any type of
              hearing aid.

                  The human ear consists of four major parts. The outer ear, the
                  middle ear, the inner ear, and the auditory nervous system are
                  these parts. Each part has a complex function in the
                  reception, transmission, and processing of sound
                </p>

                <p>
                  <span>Outer ear: </span>The outer ear is the part of your ear
                  that you can see on the outside of your head. It includes the
                  earlobe and the curved, fleshy part that surrounds the opening
                  of your ear. The main job of the outer ear is to collect sound
                  waves from the environment and funnel them into the ear canal,
                  which leads to the middle ear. This helps us hear sounds from
                  the world around us.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <span>Middle ear: </span>The middle ear is a small part of
                  your ear located between the outer ear (the part that you can
                  see) and the inner ear (deep inside your head). It includes
                  the eardrum and three tiny bones called ossicles. These parts
                  work together to transmit sound from the outer ear to the
                  inner ear, allowing you to hear and understand sounds. So, the
                  middle ear plays a crucial role in the process of hearing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>Inner ear: </span>The inner ear is a small and important
                  part of our ear that helps us hear and maintain our balance.
                  It's located deep inside the ear and consists of a complex
                  system of tiny structures and fluid-filled canals. The inner
                  ear converts sound vibrations into electrical signals that our
                  brain can understand, allowing us to hear. It also helps us
                  keep our balance by sending information to the brain about the
                  position and movement of our head. So, in simple terms, the
                  inner ear is like our body's natural "sound converter" and
                  "balance keeper."
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>Auditory nervous system:</span>
                  The auditory nervous system is like the body’s “hearing
                  network.” It includes all the parts in the body and brain that
                  help you hear and understand sounds. When you listen to music,
                  someone talking, or even a bird singing, your auditory nervous
                  system is at work, helping you process and make sense of these
                  sounds. It’s a crucial part of how we communicate and enjoy
                  the world of sound around us.

                Hearing is one of our primary senses and is the process by which
                our ears detect and interpret sound waves in the surround
                environment. When you hear a sound, like a friend’s voice or
                music, it’s because of your ears. Sound is actually vibrations
                in the air. These vibrations travel to your ear, and your ear
                turns them into something your brain can understand. So, in
                simple terms, hearing is a process where your ears catch sound
                waves, your ear parts work together to transform these waves
                into signals for your brain, and your brain makes sense of these
                signals to let you understand and identify different sounds.

                  <span>Sensorineural hearing loss:</span> A sensorineural
                  hearing loss happens when there's a problem with your inner
                  ear or the nerves that carry sound to your brain. It can
                  happen because of things like getting older, loud noises,
                  certain medications, or health issues. With this kind of
                  hearing loss, you might have trouble hearing soft sounds,
                  understanding speech clearly, or catching high-pitched noises.
                  It often sticks around and may need hearing aids or other
                  devices to help you hear better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>Conductive hearing loss:</span> A conductive hearing
                  loss happens when something in your ear, like earwax or an
                  infection, makes it hard for sound to get through to your
                  inner ear. It's like having a blockage in the way of sound,
                  which can make things sound quieter or muffled. The good news
                  is that this type of hearing loss can often be fixed with
                  medical help, like cleaning your ears or treating infections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>Mixed hearing loss:</span>
                  A mixed hearing loss happens when someone has two kinds of
                  hearing problems at the same time. One problem is called
                  sensorineural, which is about the inner ear or nerves that
                  carry sound to the brain. The other problem is called
                  conductive, which is when something in the outer or middle ear
                  blocks the sound. So, in mixed hearing loss, someone might
                  find it hard to hear sounds that are both soft and clear. They
                  could have issues with the inside of the ear and also things
                  in the ear canal like earwax or infections that make it even
                  more difficult to hear. Treating this kind of hearing loss
                  might involve using hearing aids or other devices, and
                  sometimes, medical treatments like surgery or medicine.

                <p>
                  <span>Central auditory processing disorder:</span> A central
                  auditory processing disorder (CAPD) means your brain has a bit
                  of trouble understanding sounds, even when your ears are
                  working okay. It's like the brain has a hard time sorting out
                  and making sense of the things you hear. People with CAPD
                  might find it tricky to follow instructions, especially in
                  places with lots of noise, and they might get words mixed up
                  that sound similar. It can make learning and talking a bit
                  more challenging. Specialists like audiologists and speech
                  pathologists can help a person with a central auditory
                  processing disorder.

                <i>Clarity and volume are two different aspects of sound.</i>
                <p>
                  <span>Volume:</span> Volume refers to how loud or soft a sound
                  is. When something is very loud, it's at a high volume, and
                  when it's quiet, it's at a low volume. For example, a rock
                  concert is very high in volume, and a whisper is very low in
                  volume.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>Clarity:</span> Clarity, on the other hand, is how clear
                  and easy to understand a sound is. It doesn't necessarily have
                  to do with how loud or soft the sound is. When something is
                  clear, it means you can hear and understand it well, with no
                  muffled or fuzzy parts. For instance, a clear phone call is
                  one where the words are easy to understand, even if the volume
                  is not very high.
                </p>

                In simple terms, volume is about how loud or quiet a sound is,
                while clarity is about how well you can hear and understand the
                details of that sound.

                  Choosing the right hearing aids depends on the kind of hearing
                  problem, what you need to hear, and your way of life. Hearing
                  aids come in lots of different looks and colors. There are
                  different styles of hearing aids, and they have short names
                  (abbreviations).

                      The earmold option will provide better retention of the

                      Receiver-in-Canal hearing aids consist of two main
                      components. First, there's a piece that sits behind the
                      ear. This part is connected to an earpiece that fits
                      inside the ear. The earpiece is either dome-shaped that
                      sits in your ear or an earmold which is custom-made to fit
                      your ear which keeps the device secure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Now, when you look at RIC hearing aids, they resemble
                      another type called BTE (Behind-the-Ear). However, the
                      unique thing about RICs is that the loudspeaker, which we
                      call the receiver, is placed inside the ear canal. This
                      design choice allows the part behind the ear to be smaller
                      and lighter. It can even have a larger battery, which
                      means your hearing aid can work longer before needing a
                      battery change. To make all of this work, the two pieces,
                      the one behind the ear and the earpiece inside the ear,
                      are connected by a thin wire, not a thick tube.

                A disposable battery hearing aid is a small device that helps
                people with hearing problems hear better. It works using a
                regular, replaceable battery, similar to the ones you might use
                in a TV remote. When the battery runs out of power, you need to
                remove the old one and put in a new one. These hearing aids are
                usually easy to use and don't require charging. They make sounds
                louder so that people who have trouble hearing can understand
                conversations and other noises more clearly.

                <p class="pt_30">
                  Hearing aid batteries come in different sizes, and they are
                  marked with numbers and colors to help you identify them.
                  Here's a breakdown of the common sizes:
                </p>

                <p>
                  1. Size 10 (Yellow tab): These are the smallest hearing aid
                  batteries and are often used for tiny hearing aids. They don't
                  last as long because they have less power.
                </p>

                <p>
                  2. Size 312 (Brown tab): These are a bit larger than size 10
                  batteries and are suitable for various types of hearing aids.
                  They have more power and a longer lifespan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Size 13 (Orange tab): These batteries are larger than both
                  size 10 and size 312. They work well in different hearing aids
                  and have a longer life compared to smaller sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. Size 675 (Blue tab): Size 675 batteries are the largest and
                  most powerful. They are used in larger hearing aids and last
                  the longest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The choice of battery size depends on the specific hearing aid
                  model and its power needs. It's crucial to use the right size
                  to ensure your hearing aid functions correctly. Keep in mind
                  that battery life can vary depending on factors such as the
                  battery size, the hearing aid's power consumption, and usage.
                  Regularly changing the batteries is important to avoid
                  unexpected disruptions in your hearing aid's performance.

                A rechargeable hearing aid is a small device that helps people
                hear better when they have difficulty with their hearing. Unlike
                regular hearing aids that use disposable batteries, rechargeable
                hearing aids can be charged repeatedly, just like a smartphone.
                This means you don't need to buy new batteries all the time. To
                use a rechargeable hearing aid, you simply plug it into a
                special charger, and it stores energy for when you need it.
                Then, when you put it in your ear, it helps amplify sounds,
                making it easier for you to hear and understand what's being
                said around you. This can be very helpful for people who have
                trouble hearing well.

                  A Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) hearing device is like a hearing
                  aid that makes it easier to hear and listen. You can buy these
                  online or at stores without a doctor’s suggestion. They’re
                  easier to get, but they might not be made just for your
                  hearing like the ones a healthcare expert would recommend. The

                  Over-the-Counter hearing aid is a special device that helps
                  people hear better. You can get one without a doctor's note or
                  help from a healthcare expert. These hearing aids are sold in
                  stores or on the internet without needing a doctor's
                  permission. They're easier to get, but it's important to know
                  they might not be as personalized for your own hearing needs
                  as hearing aids suggested by a healthcare professional.

                  device you can wear to turn up the volume of sounds in
                  specific places. It's not a hearing aid you get from a doctor,
                  but it helps you hear better in some situations, such as when
                  you're watching TV bird watching, or having a conversation
                  with someone. Think of it as a tiny speaker for your ear that
                  increases the sound in your surroundings.

                  ear accessory that you wear. It is not as sophisticated as a
                  hearing aid but may provide hearing assistance and can do more
                  than just help you hear better; it might also connect to your
                  smartphone and play music, take calls, or track your fitness.
                  Think of it as a smart earpiece that combines listening and

                  A landline or cell phone can always be used with a hearing aid
                  by holding the phone close to the hearing aid's microphone.
                  The microphone is usually on or near the ear where the hearing
                  aid is placed. Keeping the phone near the hearing aid helps
                  the hearing aid pick up the sound from the phone's receiver
                  (speaker), making it easier for you to hear the conversation.
                  It is sometimes better to hold the phone’s receiver closer to
                  the microphone of the hearing aid than up against your ear as
                  you typically do. This way, you can have a clear and
                  comfortable phone call.

                  invisible radio waves, just like the signals from a radio
                  station. This makes it super easy to link up devices without

                  <span>Streaming:</span> Streaming means you are sending an
                  audio signal into a hearing aid. The audio signal can be a
                  phone call, music, or a phone alert. For example, when you’re
                  talking on the phone, the sound from the call goes directly
                  into your hearing aid. It’s like having the phone call play in
                  your ear, making it easier to hear and understand the
                  conversation without needing to hold the phone close to your
                  ear. This helps people with hearing difficulties to have a
                  clearer phone conversation. For streaming to take place, both
                  your cell phone or tablet and your hearing aid must have
                  Bluetooth capability.

                  The telecoil allows the wearer’s hearing aid to connect to
                  certain phones or assistive listening devices to improve the
                  sound or signal that is delivered to the hearing aid
                  especially in nosier places. Since a telecoil requires an
                  induction coil or wire in the hearing aid it can influence the
                  size of the hearing aid. Using a telecoil and streaming are

                An Audio-Induction Hearing Loop is sometimes called a Hearing
                Loop or Audio Induction Loop. A hearing loop is a special system
                you can find in places like theaters, churches, auditoriums, or
                other big rooms. It has a wire loop or cable that's linked to a
                microphone or a sound system. This wire creates a kind of
                magnetic field. If you have a hearing aid or a cochlear implant
                with a T-coil, it can catch this magnetic field. When you turn
                on the T-coil in your hearing aid or implant, it brings the
                sound straight into your device. This makes the sound clearer
                and blocks out other noises, so it's easier for people with
                hearing problems to hear better. A venue typically advertises or
                places a sign within the facility that they have a hearing loop.
                If you do not see any sign, inquire at the ticket box office or
                with the management of the venue to see if they have a hearing
                loop at their facility.

                  Your hearing will be examined by an audiologist to determine
                  the degree and type of your hearing problem. Then, they can
                  recommend the right care for you. If your hearing problem can
                  be corrected medically, they will send you to an Ear, Nose and
                  Throat physician. If there is a not a medical problem and the
                  issue is a permanent hearing loss, the audiologist will help
                  you find solutions to your hearing problem. These solutions
                  may include hearing aids. The programming of the hearing aids
                  and other services are important to successful hearing aid
                  use. The audiologist provides this personalized care. Fitting
                  a hearing aid requires:
                </p>
                <p>1. Accurate audiometric data.</p>
                <p>
                  2. In depth knowledge of the individual’s lifestyle,
                  communication needs, hobbies, etc. so the audiologist can
                  match the technology to the individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Customized physical fit of the device (this is the coupling
                  of the hearing aid to the ear which needs to be comfortable
                  and also appropriate to the demands of the hearing loss).
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. Customized acoustic fit (measuring the sound in the
                  person’s ear canal to set the hearing aid). People who get
                  hearing aids usually have hearing loss for several years
                  before they seek help. This means that the person has been
                  listening through a filter and the person’s brain is tuned to
                  the hearing loss. The person with hearing loss perceives
                  listening through the hearing loss as “normal.” The treatment
                  for hearing loss is returning an audible signal to the
                  auditory pathway. To make sure the person can hear well with
                  their hearing aids, it's essential to ensure they can hear
                  quiet, moderate, and loud sounds at different pitches without
                  any discomfort. The audiologist can't just ask the person with
                  hearing loss if they like how the hearing aids sound, because
                  they may not know what's right due to having hearing loss over
                  the years. To set up a hearing aid properly, the audiologist
                  puts a tiny microphone in the person's ear and checks how the
                  hearing aid works with quiet, moderate, and loud sounds. This
                  helps the audiologist adjust the hearing aid so that it makes
                  sounds easy to hear at different pitches and volumes.

                  People who have gradually lost their hearing, which is common
                  as people get older, need to wear their hearing aids all the
                  time when they're awake for about 2-3 weeks to adjust to the
                  new sounds. People who wear their hearing aids full time (when
                  they are awake) get the most benefit. When they first start
                  using the hearing aids, it's normal not to like them during
                  the first week. That's because the brain isn't used to all the
                  sounds they can hear now. They might feel like everything is
                  too loud and noisy. But if they use the hearing aids all the
                  time when they are awake, their brain gets used to these new
                  sounds over a few weeks, and the annoying sounds become less
                  noticeable. This adjustment won't happen if they only use the
                  hearing aids sometimes. When people only use the hearing aids
                  part-time, their brain doesn't fully adapt to the new sounds,
                  and they might say that things are too loud and noisy, and it
                  bothers them. It's important that a person gets use to their
                  hearing aids before deciding to keep them. That's why each
                  state in the U.S. has a law that allows a person at least 30
                  days to decide whether prescription hearing aids are helping
                  them and whether they want to keep or return them. If they
                  return them, they should expect to receive a refund for the
                  majority of what they have paid with a small amount being kept
                  by the practice to cover the time dedicated to this process.
