    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Acoustic and electrophysiological assays of the auditory system offer an objective, non-invasive window into the integrity and function of the ascending auditory pathway. This course will focus on the measurement, mechanisms of generation, interpretation, and clinical application of auditory evoked responses. Features of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) across the continuum of normal hearing and diverse forms of hearing loss, and applications across the lifespan are emphasized.</p>
    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Describe normal auditory system function as it relates to the generation and interpretation of common objective audiological measures.</li>
        <li>Define and differentiate key terminology, and select appropriate types of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and electrophysiological responses for specific clinical applications.</li>
        <li>Analyze OAE and auditory brainstem response (ABR) waveforms by identifying and annotating salient features in normal hearing, and predict expected changes across different types of hearing loss.</li>
        <li>Apply evidence-based interpretation strategies to OAE and ABR data in example cases to estimate hearing sensitivity and support hearing screening decisions.</li>
        <li>Evaluate OAE and ABR findings in example cases to inform differential diagnosis and generate clinically appropriate recommendations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Learning Resources, Technology, &amp; Texts</h2>
    <h3>Canvas</h3>
    <p>Materials, assignments, and grades for the course will be posted on <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canvas</a>. Canvas will serve as the starting point for all course material. Materials may also be hosted elsewhere and links provided on Canvas.</p>
    <h3>Textbooks</h3>
    <p>There are <strong>no</strong> required textbooks. Readings from primary literature, class notes/slides, and other handouts/resources will be posted on Canvas.</p>
    <h3>Supplemental References</h3>

    </ol>
    <h3>Required software</h3>
    <p>For several quizzes and the final exam, we will utilize <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Colaboratory</a> to manipulate, analyze, and interpret case/test examples of otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response data. Google Colaboratory is a cloud-based platform equipped with pre-installed software libraries tailored for these analyses. Basic access to Colaboratory is complimentary with a Google account. You may use an existing Google account or create a new one at no cost specifically for this course. Detailed instructions on how to access and utilize Colaboratory will be provided in class and in conjunction with relevant quizzes.</p>
    <h3>Discussion Forum</h3>
    <p>We will use the group discussion board within Canvas for Q&amp;A and discussion. Rather than emails, using the discussion board is the preferred method for asking questions outside class. Using the discussion board allows for getting help quickly and efficiently both from classmates, and the instructor. You are encouraged to ask <em>and answer</em> questions about logistics, content, quizzes, and exams. However, please do <em>not</em> share explicit solutions to quizzes, etc. You are also encouraged to share any ideas, articles, videos, or other resources related to the course (or audiology more broadly) that you think would be interesting and/or beneficial to others.</p>
    <h2>Quizzes</h2>
    <p>Quizzes (six) will typically be made available a week before they are due. Quizzes will probe your understanding of the concepts/content discussed in this course and integration of the ideas with ideas gained from clinical experience, readings of primary literature, and with lab exercises (done as part of the Clinical Procedures Lab course with Dr. Alscher). Quizzes will also involve hands-on exercises working through simulated and/or real case examples and applying knowledge from the course to analyze and interpret physiological measurement results. Quizzes may also involve watching video presentations by other professionals/scientists. Submitted work will consist of electronic responses or PDF file uploads via Canvas. All quizzes are due by the time and date posted on Canvas. You are encouraged to discuss course topics with your peers and other colleagues, but discussions involving quizzes should be done <em>in broad/general terms</em>. Please do not share specific solutions.</p>
    <p>There is a quota of <strong>three total late days</strong> you can use throughout the semester to manage unanticipated pressing events that may prevent you from submitting quizzes on time. Save and use them judiciously. You can use all three days for one assignment or spread them over (up to) three assignments. Note however that part-day delays (e.g., late by 2 hours) will count as 1 whole day of quota being used up. No submissions will be accepted, even if you have unused late days, after April 30, 2026 (Final exam day). For any additional delays beyond the 3-day rule, there is a 20% penalty per day applied to the corresponding quizzes. Exceptions will only be made in unavoidable circumstances (e.g., extended health<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> issue) about which you discuss with the instructor as soon as the situation permits, and make alternative arrangements.</p>
    <p id="fn1"><strong>1</strong>: Mental health <em>is</em> health.</p>
    <h3>Exams</h3>
    <p>This course includes an in-class midterm exam and an in-class final exam. Each exam will assess material and concepts covered up to that point in the semester, with the final exam serving as a cumulative assessment of the full course. The purpose of these exams is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the material and your ability to integrate and apply concepts at a graduate level within the scope of audiology as a discipline. Questions may ask you to apply ideas to case scenarios, use course concepts to support reasoning and decision-making in audiological contexts, or read brief excerpts from research literature and connect those findings to material we have discussed. Exams are open to physical resources (personal notes, textbooks, printed materials) and to digital files stored locally on your computer. Internet access is <strong>not</strong> permitted, with the exception of Google Colab, which may be required for designated questions. Beyond that, websites, searches, AI tools, messaging platforms, and communication with others are off limits during the exam. Exams are designed to take about 75&ndash;90 minutes, but you are welcome to use the full 170-minute class period so that time pressure is not a significant factor. The aim is to create a fair and supportive environment where you can demonstrate what you know, how you think, and how you are developing as an emerging professional in the field of audiology.</p>
    <h2>Tentative schedule</h2>
    <p>Each class will be broken into three sessions of about 50 mins each with two 10-minute breaks in between.</p>

    <p>The standard grading scale for our SLP and AuD programs will be used in this course.</p>
    <p>A+: 98 - 100<br />A : 94 - 97<br />A-: 90 - 93<br />B+: 87 - 89<br />B : 84 - 86<br />B-: 80 - 83<br />C+: 78 - 79<br />C : 76 - 77<br />C-: 70 - 75<br />D+: 67 - 69<br />D : 63 - 66<br />D-: 60 - 62<br />F : below 60</p>
    <p>In order to meet the CFCC and CAA standards across all areas of skills and knowledge addressed in this course, you must score 60% or higher on each quiz and the midterm exam, <strong>and</strong> maintain an <em>overall</em> grade of C or higher (i.e., 76% or more). If you score below the criterion level on any individual assignment, you will be required to complete remediation. For quizzes, remediation may be initiated independently by submitting additional attempts on Canvas within seven days of receiving the grade that requires remediation. For the midterm exam, if you score below 60%, you must contact an instructor within seven days of receiving the grade to initiate a remediation plan; the specific requirements and deadlines will be determined by the instructor in consultation with the student.</p>
    <p>Remediation activities that remain incomplete at the end of the term will result in an &ldquo;I&rdquo; grade for the course, even if you are otherwise passing, as remediation indicates that course requirements have not yet been fully met. If the agreed-upon remediation is not completed within one semester after receiving an &ldquo;I&rdquo; grade, you will fail the remediation and be required to repeat the course. If your overall grade falls below a C at any point, you may be required to retake the course.</p>
    <h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
    <p>Face-to-face meeting in class is the primary modality of instruction and in-person attendance is generally expected for all classes throughout the semester. However, absence due to unavoidable reasons will be accommodated. To facilitate this, lectures/seminars will also be available asynchronously via recorded video. If you need to miss a class, please inform the instructor in a timely manner (if the situation permits). In such cases, it is your responsibility to catch up with the material that you miss using the asynchronously available video recordings. If extended absence and schedule adjustments are necessitated by unavoidable circumstances, please contact the instructor for working out alternative arrangements as soon as the situation permits. Note that office hours and the discussion forum are available to assist you as well.</p>
    <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
    <p>Students in this course will be expected to comply with the <a href="https://www.provost.pitt.edu/info/ai1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Pittsburgh&rsquo;s Policy on Academic Integrity</a>. Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity. This may include, but is not limited to, the confiscation of the examination of any individual suspected of violating University Policy. Furthermore, no student may bring any unauthorized materials to an exam, including dictionaries and programmable calculators.</p>
    <p>To learn more about Academic Integrity, visit the <a href="http://pitt.libguides.com/academicintegrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Integrity Guide</a> for an overview of the topic. For hands-on practice, complete the <a href="http://pitt.libguides.com/academicintegrity/plagiarism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understanding and Avoiding Plagiarism tutorial</a>.</p>
    <h3>Use of Generative AI Tools in Academic Work</h3>
    <p>Students are allowed to use generative AI tools, such as large language models, as supplementary resources for this course. However, the use of these tools must adhere to the following guidelines to maintain academic integrity and scholarly values:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Attribution</strong><br />Any direct outputs from a generative AI tool that are included in academic work must be clearly cited. Failing to do so may constitute plagiarism.</li>
        <li><strong>Original Thought</strong><br />Generative AI should be used to augment rather than replace original thinking and scholarship. Your work should primarily reflect your own understanding and synthesis of the subject matter. Examples of acceptable uses of AI tools include idea generation, outlining, proofreading, and grammar checks. Examples of unacceptable use include whole-section generation, substituting AI-generated analyses or arguments for your own, and automated research. While there is no fixed ratio for AI-generated vs. student-generated content, a good rule of thumb is that the bulk (for instance, &gt;80&ndash;90%) of your written output should be your own work, both in content and in analysis, even when properly cited.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Evaluation</strong><br />Exercise critical judgment when using AI-generated content. Not all information produced by an AI tool will be accurate, verifiable, or valid in an academic context. You are responsible for the accuracy and integrity of any material you submit.</li>
        <li><strong>Exams</strong><br />Generative AI tools may not be used during exams unless explicitly permitted. Unauthorized use during exams will be treated as an academic integrity violation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Religious Observances</h2>
    <p>The University of Pittsburgh strives to foster a supportive environment and to respect the beliefs and values of all community members. Accordingly, recognizing that certain students may observe religious holidays (activities observed by a religious group of which a student is a member) and cultural practices that conflict with scheduled class activities, instructors will work with students to try to make reasonable accommodations in the event of such a conflict.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the semester, you should review the course requirements to identify foreseeable conflicts with assignments, exams, or other required attendance. If you identify a conflict, please contact your instructor (or your course coordinator/s), ideally within the first two weeks of the first class meeting, to allow time to discuss and attempt to make fair and reasonable adjustments to the schedule and/or tasks.</p>
    <h2>Statement on Classroom Recording</h2>
    <p>To ensure the free and open discussion of ideas, students may not record classroom lectures, discussion and/or activities without the advance written permission of the instructor, and any such recording properly approved in advance can be used solely for the student&rsquo;s own private use.</p>
