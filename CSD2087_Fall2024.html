        <strong>Abstract: </strong> Noise is present in everyday life and can be classified as traumatic (such as a firework) or average and considerably safe (such as daily conversational exposure). The article review addresses is central damage occurs as a result of this non-traumatic noise exposure long-term. Clinically patients will audiometric normal hearing thresholds will report disproportional difficulties with speech perception and listening with competing noise which indicates subclinical auditory damage. These symptoms align closely with central auditory processing disorder (APD).  Although there are tests for sound processing symptoms (temporal, binaural integration testing, speech in noise), there is not yet a measure of central function used clinically. In part, the lack of test development contributes to the ongoing research required to fully understand the mechanisms of central auditory damage. The articles reviewed in this presentation use animal and human data to support that central system damage does occur evident by tonotopic re-organization, overall degradation in neural synchrony, changes in spontaneous firing rates, and more. Frequency representation changes were represented in the midbrain, thalamus, and cortex.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Cisplatin, a widely used platinum-based chemotherapy, is effective in treating various cancers, but its ototoxicity presents a significant long-term health challenge. Recently, sodium thiosulfate (STS) has emerged as a potential agent to protect against hearing loss when administered following cisplatin treatment. This presentation evaluates the effectiveness of STS in mitigating hearing impairment induced by cisplatin.  A Phase III trial by Brock et al. investigated the use of STS infusion in children with liver cancer undergoing cisplatin treatment. In this study, STS was administered 6 hours after cisplatin infusion and compared to a control group that received no STS. The primary endpoint was hearing threshold changes, with secondary endpoints including overall survival and event-free survival. Similarly, a meta-analysis by Chen et al. reviewed data from four clinical trials to assess the impact of STS on ototoxicity and survival outcomes. Both the trial and the meta-analysis provide evidence that STS significantly reduces the risk of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity without affecting survival rates.  The FDA-approved PEDMARK formulation of STS in 2020 offers a promising therapeutic approach for preventing hearing loss in pediatric cancer patients. Further research is needed to explore the potential impact of STS on long-term survival and other chemotherapy-related adverse effects. Overall, this topic highlights the importance of addressing ototoxicity as a critical aspect of cancer care and the need to advocate for hearing protection and preservation during cancer treatment.

        <strong>Abstract: </strong> Hair cell regeneration naturally occurs in animals, specifically non-mammalian vertebrates. In studying this occurrence and attempting to mimic the response, it has been revealed that sensory hair cells are not spontaneously generated, but due to the presence of supporting hair cells. Supporting hair cells (SCs) exist in both the cochlea and vestibule and help maintain structure and homeostasis of their resident organs and the sensory hair cells. In the presence of damage and hearing hair cell loss, existing SCs in animal studies utilize the transcription factor Atoh1 to differentiation themselves to either regenerate themselves via reprogramming or transdifferentiating to sensory hearing hair cells. Studies in this presentation looked at the role of Atoh1 and other cellular pathways (Myc, Notch1, Wnt and cAMP) in stimulating hair cell regeneration processes. In application to human hearing loss, support cells will also play a critical role in hair cell regeneration. Human clinical trial challenges lie in candidacy and appropriate outcome measures.

        <strong>Abstract: </strong> Ototoxicity is drug-induced auditory or vestibular insult. It is a common symptom of aminoglycoside use, and can present as cochleotoxicity or vestibulotoxicity. Patients with Cystic Fibrosis are at risk for bacterial infections from pseudomonas, which are treated with the use of aminoglycosides. This presentation will review if it is sufficient to monitor just hearing or if vestibular monitoring should be completed as well in patients with Cystic Fibrosis. Handelsman, et al. (2017), investigate the prevalence of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in Cystic Fibrosis patients who received aminoglycoside treatments. They completed audiologic and vestibular assessments to quantify the number of patients within the cohort who developed vestibular and auditory insult. They determined that the overall presence or vestibular insult was high, and patients are often able to compensate resulting in a missed diagnosis until symptoms worsen. Scheenstra, et al. (2019), investigated the prevalence of tobramysic-induced vestibulotoxicity in Cystic Fibrosis patients. They completed electronystagmography with caloric irrigation, physical examinations, and standardized questionnaires to investigate the impact. They found that CF patients with cumulative exposure to tobramycin are at risk for vestibulotoxicity. They noted that slow-onset vestibular dysfunction and vague symptoms can often lead to a misdiagnosis. For this reason, early recognition and diagnosis is essential to prevent further vestibular insult. In conclusion, it is essential to monitor for both vestibulotoxicity and otoxicity in patients with CF who are taking aminoglycosides. Symptoms of vestibular insult can be slow to progress and patients may compensate, so testing is important for early diagnosis.

        <strong>Abstract: </strong> Jet Fuel Propellant Type 8 (JP-8) is a kerosene type fuel and is the most common fuel used in military services. It is made of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, which is one of the most common occupational chemical exposures for both military and civilian workers. The purpose of this presentation is to determine what makes Jet Fuel (JP-8) Ototoxic and learn how it affects our auditory/vestibular systems. Exposure to hydrocarbon can damage functions of the central nervous system and impair an individual's auditory system. One theory behind this is that the aromatic solvents reduce the effectiveness of the acoustic reflex. In a study completed by Fuente et al., 2019, individuals were grouped into low, moderate, and high jet fuel exposure groups and completed different audiologic measures such as pure tone audiometry, DPOAE’s, ABR, and central auditory testing. The results indicated that individuals with lower jet fuel exposure performed better in all areas of testing. A second article by Fife et al., 2018, looked at vestibular dysfunction because of chronic JP-8 exposure. 3 individuals complaining of dizziness had vestibular evaluations reveal reduced gain in rotational testing and led to a vestibular dysfunction diagnosis related to their exposure of JP-8. In 2 cases, their caloric responses improved once they were removed from the environment, indicating that an early diagnosis and limiting any further exposure can potentially improve their quality of life.  Overall, both the auditory and vestibular system can be negatively affected by exposure to JP-8.

        <strong>Abstract: </strong> Research suggests that approximately 60% of patients receiving cisplatin-based cancer treatment experience permanent hearing shifts. Given the prevalence of military and age-related hearing loss among veterans, ototoxicity monitoring programs within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VAHCS) are necessary to track and manage hearing changes caused by platinum-based chemotherapies. The Comprehensive Ototoxicity Monitoring Program in the VA (COMP-VA) is a proposed protocol designed to predict, monitor, and treat hearing changes during cisplatin treatment. This program recommends a baseline hearing evaluation, screenings before each cisplatin treatment, and a follow-up evaluation after treatment completion. The six clinical objectives of the COMP-VA include identifying ototoxicity risk, determining the patient’s sensitivity range for ototoxicity (SRO), screening for outer hair cell dysfunction, screening for the onset or worsening of tinnitus, performing follow-ups for screening failures, and education on ototoxins and ototoxic hearing loss. Despite the benefits of the COMP-VA, ototoxicity monitoring programs continue to not be well defined within the VAHCS. VA audiologists and service chiefs agree on the importance of ototoxicity monitoring programs, especially pretreatment baseline testing, early detection of ototoxic hearing changes, and hearing management pre/post chemotherapy treatment. They note that barriers to care include challenges in coordinating referrals with the oncology team, the audiology workload, and a lack of standardized protocols. These results highlight the need for standardized ototoxicity monitoring  and effective interdisciplinary communication with the oncology team. These should be set in place to ensure veterans receive the best possible care in a timely manner.

        <strong>Abstract: </strong> Twenty-two million workers are exposed to hazardous noise on the job each year, and many do not wear hearing protection. This presentation aims to address what factors influence why many industrial workers do not wear hearing protection. The article by Green et al. 2021 looked at how many individuals do not use hearing protection devices (HPD) when exposed to occupational noise. Using self-reported NHIS survey data from 2007 and 2014, they found that of the 2-3,000 included participants, over 50% do not use HPD. HPD non-use is highest in females, young adults, smokers, and in the fields of arts, recreation, entertainment, agriculture, fishing, and hunting. The article by Fauzan et al. 2023 conducted a systematic review using PRISMA to look at what factors influence HPD usage among industrial workers. The 28 included articles showed that a variety of sociodemographic characteristics, interpersonal and situational influences, cognitive-perceptual factors, and health promotional behaviors play big roles in the decision of whether industrial workers decide to use HPD. Conclusions drawn from both these articles indicate that societal norms, individual perceptions, personal barriers, and company morale are all factors that influence why an individual may not be wearing HPDs. Proper device selection, increased site-specific educational training, and advocacy can help push individuals to wear HPDs at their occupations that have high levels of noise exposure. New research needs to be completed to provide updates on where individuals are today in terms of wearing HPDs.

        <strong>Abstract: </strong> There is significant evidence to support the need for hearing protection from loud music exposure. Musicians understand this, but it is not practical for logistical and preference reasons. I wanted to explore evidence that validated the musicians’ perspective and determine realistic current options. The article titled Effect of Hearing Protection Use on Pianists' Performance and Experience: Comparing Foam and Musician Earplugs by Boissinot et. al. in 2022 utilized subjective and acoustic measures to determine the effects of different hearing protections (musician earplugs, foam earplugs, and no earplugs) on performance. They found that loudness was compensated according to attenuation, especially when playing less familiar music, no effect on dynamic range, and an acclimation effect when playing a piece a second time. In questionnaires, participants reported a change in “coloration”, difficulty gauging dynamics and articulation, and a preference for musicians’ earplugs over foam. While these findings may not generalize across musicians, they highlight familiarity of music and acclimation to hearing protection as partial solutions. The study by Beach and Miller in 2019, titled Time to Listen: Most Regular Patrons of Music Venues Prefer Lower Volumes conducted surveys of patrons of night clubs and live music events. They found that most prefer lower levels and are aware of noise exposure risks. These results can help encourage venues to lower sound levels which would benefit the hearing of audiences and musicians as well as be good for business due to patron preference.
