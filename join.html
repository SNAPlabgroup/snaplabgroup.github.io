  <h1 class="mt-4">Join the Lab</h1>

  
    <h2>For Prospective Ph.D. Students:</h2>
    <p>You can join SNAPlab by applying to the Ph.D. program offered by the <a href="https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/phdcsd">Department of Communication Science and Disorders</a>, or <a href="https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/departments/bioengineering/programs/graduate/graduate-overview/">Bioengineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh (Pitt)</a>. It is also possible to join the lab through the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ni/academics/pnc"> Ph.D. Program in Neural Computation (PNC)</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. If you are interested in the research done at SNAPlab, feel free to send an email to Hari Bharadwaj directly to discuss your interests. Please attach a copy of your CV.</p>

    <p>If you are already admitted to a PhD program at Pitt (any department) and looking for a research home for your Ph.D., please contact Hari to discuss possible openings if you have a strong interest in studying the neuroscience of auditory perception.</p>

    <p>The work done in the lab is interdisciplinary, and typically involves some combination of collecting and analyzing physiological data from human subjects, processing and synthesizing sounds, conducting listening experiments, and building computational models to integrate the knowledge into a broader framework. Thus, there are at least two different, complementary candidate profiles that would be a good fit for the lab:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Candidates with a strong quantitative background</strong>, i.e., some familiarity with signal processing, linear algebra, probability and statistics, machine learning etc. (e.g., through engineering, applied math, or applied physics programs) with a strong interest in applying their background to interesting problems in the neuroscience of hearing and hearing loss, and willingness to work with human subjects.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Candidates with a background in neuroscience, audiology, psychology, hearing science, or cognitive science</strong>, with a strong interest in the neuroscience of hearing and hearing loss, and a commitment to sharpening broadly-valuable quantitative skills (i.e., signal processing, statistics, etc.).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The above is just intended to give you a better sense of what working in the lab may entail, and not meant to discourage if your background is somewhat different. If you are keen about the research done here, please feel free to contact Hari to discuss the fit. Regardless of your background, strong communication and writing are essential.</p>


    <h2>For Pitt Au.D. Students</h2>
    <p>If you are an Au.D. student at Pitt interested in getting involved in auditory neuroscience research, please contact Hari directly to discuss your interest and the timeframe you have in mind.</p>

    <h2>For Pitt Undergraduates</h2>
    <p>If you are at Pitt and would like to gain research experience studying the neuroscience of auditory perception, send an email to Hari directly to discuss your interests.</p>

    <h2>For Prospective Postdocs:</h2>
    <p>If you are interested in a post-doctoral collaboration with SNAPlab, please get in touch with Hari directly to discuss the research question(s) you are interested in pursuing, and what you hope to gain out of the training, i.e., the pathway you envision towards wherever you want to go next. Please attach a copy of your CV and a publication (where your contribution was as a leading and/or corresponding author).</p>
